## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Accuracy Boost
- **Baseline Accuracy:** Establish a starting point for accuracy measurement.
- **Model Accuracy Improvement:** Evaluate the percentage improvement achieved through advanced ensemble methods, particularly AdaBoost.
- **Optimal Model Configuration:** Identify optimal hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, learning_rate) for maximizing accuracy.

### Feature Insights
- **Common Key Features:** Identify recurrent essential features like Initial, Fare category, Pclass, and Family Size across multiple classifiers.
- **Gender Influence:** Assess the consistent impact of gender-related features, such as Sex and Initial, on prediction accuracy.
- **Class and Family Dynamics:** Explore the connection between socio-economic class (Pclass), fare categories (Fare_cat), and family-related features (Family Size, Alone, Parch, SibSp).

### Overall Success Criteria
- Achieve a significant accuracy boost compared to baseline models.
- Uncover critical features contributing to accurate predictions.
- Optimize model parameters for the best possible performance.
